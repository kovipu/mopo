module Constants exposing (colorEscape, closeEscape)

-- I hid constants in this file, to allow elm-format to run on Main.elm.
-- Elm format will fail on this file as there's unknown characters here.

-- Your editor probably shows whitespace, but trust me the symbols are there.
-- 0x16
colorEscape =
    ""

-- 0x1c
closeEscape =
    ""
